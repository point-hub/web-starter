npm install -g bun
```

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lock
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
bun run preview
```
